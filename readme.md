#TODO 
- Finish adding macro and calories to backend.
- Finish the new ingredients table in the backend.
- Add front end functionality for macro and calories for ingredients.
- Add Custom ingredients page similiar to custom recipes page.
- Add macros and calories to recipes and sum them up. (Sum macros on the fly when displaying info pulled from the database so updates anywhere are shown correctly for macros and calories.)
- Add clickable item boxes that pop open a modal for either editing or displaying more information about the item with an edit button on it perhaps.
- Maybe add clickable boxes to shopping list rows so that more info can be displayed or maybe a popup when hovering over it with more info.
- Add changeable weeks for meal plan selector in frontend & functionality.
- Add functionality to homepage todays meals.
- Add search page from recipes made by admin and users in the search
- incorporate old search from api into a search based system that appear also in the search result for keywords. (store these as admin recipes?)


    Next add ingredients tab and page similiar to custom recipes page include a button to add new ingredient and a button to search the public database of ingredients not first priority.
